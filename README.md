Objective
In this assignment, you will work in pairs to create a JavaScript application that retrieves and displays UOB student nationality data from the Bahrain Open Data Portal using their public API.

Background on APIs
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs enable developers to access and interact with data and services from external sources. In this assignment, you'll use a web API to retrieve educational statistics.

For more information about APIs, refer to the comprehensive Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API
